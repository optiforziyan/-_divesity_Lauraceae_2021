# Current climate overrides past climate change in explaining multi-site beta diversity of Lauraceae species in China 

## Supplemental materials including R codes and datasets generated and/or analyzed during the study

### (1) Simultaneous autoregressive models (Kissling & Carl, 2008)
Best fitted SAR models predicting Sørensen-based multi-site dissimilarity (βsor) and its underlying true turnover (βsim) and nestedness (βsne) components for Chinese Lauraceae. R codes and data used for SAR analysis are given here to ensure reproducible results during the pre-review process.

### (2) Predicted distribution maps
Distribution maps calculated by ensemble of small models (ESMs, Breiner et al., 2015, 2018) for all species.  Binary map generated by ESMs and the continuous suitability maps produced by ESMs and the four algorithms, namely generalized linear model (GLM), classification and regression trees (CTA), 
artificial neural networks (ANN), maximum entropy (MAXENT.Phillips) are displaying for each species.

### (3) Species occurrence data including personal observations
