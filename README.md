# Disentangling the drivers of large-scale beta diversity of Lauraceae species in China

## Supplemental materials including R codes and datasets generated and/or analyzed during the study

(a) [Structural equation modelling:](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Beta_divesity_Lauraceae_2021/tree/main/Structural%20equation%20models) 
Structural equation models (SEMs) for the (a) Complete, (b) Subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest, (c) Tropical monsoon forest, rain forest, (d) Alpine vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and (e) Warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest data sets of Lauraceae spp. in China. R codes and data used for SEM analysis are given here to ensure reproducible results.
