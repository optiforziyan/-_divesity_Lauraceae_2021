# Disentangling the drivers of large-scale beta diversity of Lauraceae species in China

## Supplemental materials including R codes and datasets generated and/or analyzed during the study

(a) [Structural equation modelling:](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Beta_divesity_Lauraceae_2021/tree/main/Structural%20equation%20models) 
Structural equation models (SEMs) for the (a) Complete, (b) Subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest, (c) Tropical monsoon forest, rain forest, (d) Alpine vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and (e) Warm temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest data sets of Lauraceae spp. in China. R codes and data used for SEM analysis as well as variation partitioning are given here to ensure reproducible results during the pre-review process.

(b) [Predicted distribution maps:](https://github.com/optiforziyan/Beta_divesity_Lauraceae_2021/tree/main/Predicted%20maps) 
Distribution maps calculated by ensemble of small models (ESMs) for all species.  Binary map generated by ESMs and the continuous suitability maps produced by ESMs and the four algorithms, namely generalized linear model (GLM), classification and regression trees (CTA), 
artificial neural networks (ANN), maximum entropy (MAXENT.Phillips) are displaying for each species.
